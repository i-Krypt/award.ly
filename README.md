### Behavior Driven Development
* The application should display Projects.
* When a user clicks Review the  project should display apage to review that project.
* When a user enters a search term on the search input and submits it, then they should be able to get a result of what they are looking for or if the term does not exist, they should get a message to inform them.
* When a user click view site they should be redirect to a page with the Project of the day.
